# Amazon EKS AMI Build Specification

This repository contains resources and configuration scripts for building a
custom Amazon EKS AMI with [HashiCorp Packer](https://www.packer.io/). This is
the same configuration that Amazon EKS uses to create the official Amazon
EKS-optimized AMI.

## 🚀 Getting started

If you are new to Amazon EKS, we recommend that you follow
our [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
chapter in the Amazon EKS User Guide. If you already have a cluster, and you
want to launch a node group with your new AMI, see [Launching Amazon EKS Worker
Nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html).

## 🔢 Pre-requisites

You must have [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) version 1.8.0 or later installed on your local system.
For more information, see [Installing Packer](https://www.packer.io/docs/install/index.html)
in the Packer documentation. You must also have AWS account credentials
configured so that Packer can make calls to AWS API operations on your behalf.
For more information, see [Authentication](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/amazon.html#specifying-amazon-credentials)
in the Packer documentation.

## 👷 Building the AMI

A Makefile is provided to build the Amazon EKS Worker AMI, but it is just a small wrapper around
invoking Packer directly. You can initiate the build process by running the
following command in the root of this repository:

```bash
# build an AMI with the latest Kubernetes version
make

# build an AMI with a specific Kubernetes version
make 1.25
```

The Makefile chooses a particular kubelet binary to use per Kubernetes version which you can [view here](Makefile).

> **Note**
> The default instance type to build this AMI does not qualify for the AWS free tier.
> You are charged for any instances created when building this AMI.

## 👩‍💻 Using the AMI

The [AMI user guide](doc/USER_GUIDE.md) has details about the AMI's internals, and the [EKS user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html#launch-template-custom-ami) explains how to use a custom AMI in a managed node group.
