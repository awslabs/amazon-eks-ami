### Collect EKS logs using SSM agent

#### To run EKS log collector script on Worker Node(s) and upload the bundle(tar) to a S3 Bucket using SSM agent, please follow below steps

##### Prerequisites

* Configure AWS CLI on the system where you will run the below commands. The IAM entity (User/Role) should have permissions to run/invoke `aws ssm create-document`, `aws ssm send-command` and `aws ssm get-command-invocation` commands.

  * `ssm:CreateDocument`
  * `ssm:GetCommandInvocation`
  * `ssm:SendCommand`

* SSM agent should be installed and running on Worker Node(s). [How to Install SSM Agent link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-manual-agent-install.html)

* Worker Node(s) should have required permissions to communicate with SSM service. IAM managed role `AmazonEC2RoleforSSM` will have all the required permission for SSM agent to run on EC2 instances. The IAM managed role `AmazonEC2RoleforSSM` has `S3:PutObject` permission to all S3 resources.

*Note:* For more granular control of the IAM permission check [Actions defined by AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_awssystemsmanager.html%23awssystemsmanager-actions-as-permissions)

* A S3 bucket location is required which is taken as an input parameter to `aws ssm send-command` command, to which the logs should be pushed.

#### To invoke SSM agent to run EKS log collector script and push bundle to S3 from Worker Node(s)

1. Create the SSM document named "EKSLogCollector" using the following commands:

```
aws ssm create-document \
  --name "EKSLogCollectorWindows" \
  --document-type "Command" \
  --content https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/master/log-collector-script/windows/eks-ssm-content.json
```

2. To execute the bash script in the SSM document and to collect the logs from worker, run the following command:

```
aws ssm send-command \
  --instance-ids <EC2 Instance ID> \
  --document-name "EKSLogCollectorWindows" \
  --parameters "bucketName=<S3 bucket name to push the logs>" \
  --output json
```

3. To check the status of SSM command submitted in previous step use the command

```
aws ssm get-command-invocation \
  --command-id "<SSM command ID>" \
  --instance-id "<EC2 Instance ID>" \
  --output text
```

4. Once the above command is executed successfully, the logs should be present in the S3 bucket specified in the previous step.
