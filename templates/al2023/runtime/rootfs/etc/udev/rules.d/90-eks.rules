# the 'add' workflow requires IMDS consistency, so we use a template unit to run
# and provide native restarts. it also executes non-blocking so that the udev
# event fires and triggers systemd-networkd to start probing network readiness.

# be called because when the interface does not exist the network configuration
# is a noop. if the interface returns, it is re-configured in-place.
