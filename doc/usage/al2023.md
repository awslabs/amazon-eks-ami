| `binary_bucket_name` |  |
| `binary_bucket_region` |  |
| `containerd_version` |  |
| `creator` |  |
| `enable_accelerator` | Vendor that provides the GPU or accelerator hardware. Currently we support Neuron and NVIDIA. |
| `enable_efa` | Valid options are ```true``` or ```false```. Wheather or not to install the software needed to use AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) network interfaces. |
| `enable_fips` | Install openssl and enable fips related kernel parameters |
| `encrypted` |  |

| `instance_type` |  |
| `kms_key_id` |  |
| `kubernetes_build_date` |  |
| `kubernetes_version` |  |
| `launch_block_device_mappings_volume_size` |  |
| `nodeadm_build_image` | Image to use as a build environment for nodeadm |
| `nvidia_driver_major_version` | To be used only when ```enable_accelerator = nvidia```. Driver version to install, depends on what is available in NVIDIA repository. |
| `nvidia_repository_url` | YUM/DNF Repository override for the NVIDIA driver packages |

| `source_ami_id` |  |
| `source_ami_owners` |  |
| `ssh_interface` | If using ```session_manager```, you need to specify a non-minimal ami as the minimal version does not have the SSM agent installed. |
| `ssh_username` |  |
| `ssm_agent_version` | Version of the SSM agent to install from the S3 bucket provided by the SSM agent project, such as ```latest```. If empty, the latest version of the SSM agent available in the Amazon Linux core repositories will be installed. |
| `subnet_id` |  |
| `temporary_key_pair_type` |  |
| `temporary_security_group_source_cidrs` |  |
| `user_data_file` | Path to a file that will be used for the user data when launching the instance. |
| `volume_type` |  |
| `working_dir` | Directory path for ephemeral resources on the builder instance |

## Accelerated images

One can build images that contain Neuron or Nvidia drivers and runtime configuration. To build Neuron image execute:

```
make k8s=1.29 os_distro=al2023 enable_accelerator=neuron enable_efa=true
```

To build NVIDIA image execute:
```
make k8s=1.29 os_distro=al2023 enable_accelerator=nvidia enable_efa=true
```

One can pass the NVIDIA driver major version using the following:
```
make k8s=1.29 os_distro=al2023 enable_accelerator=nvidia enable_efa=true nvidia_driver_major_version=560
```
To see which driver versions are available, one can check the NVIDIA AL2023 [repository](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/amzn2023/).

## Pause Container Image

Since [PR #2000](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/pull/2000), the pause
container image is no longer pulled in at runtime on AL2023. `nodeadm` uses a
static pause container reference to populate the
[`sandbox_image`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/963c2160485631c3d4c1068aa28cea34c884a347/docs/cri/config.md?plain=1#L314-L315)
field of the containerd config.toml, which is baked into the AMI during the
build based on the packer template variable `pause_container_image`.

The default for `pause_container_image` points to an EKS-owned ECR image, but
you can also use another pause image entirely such as `registry.k8s.io/pause`.

If you need coordinates for a different ECR image in another region, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-ons-images.html for a list
of region-specific registries that hold identical repositories.

Additionally, if you would like to use a FIPS endpoint, this will require just a
minor change to the registry URI:
```diff
-<ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.<DOMAIN>"
+<ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr-fips.<REGION>.<DOMAIN>"
```
